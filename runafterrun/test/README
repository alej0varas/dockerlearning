Trying to undestand why even postgres was started client couldn't connect.

It's because eache command is run in a different container so calling

RUN /etc/init.d/postgres start
RUN psql ...

Gives an error about server not running. This is fine. It should be run like

RUN /etc/init.d/postgres start && psql ...
